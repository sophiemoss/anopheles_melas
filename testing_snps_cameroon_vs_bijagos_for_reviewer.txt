# 9th August 2024
# 1. split vcf into samples_filtered_bijagos.vcf.gz and samples_filtered_cameroon.vcf.gz
# 2. used bcftools filter -e "AC==0" samples_filtered_cameroon.vcf.gz -O z -o samples_filtered_cameroon_AC0.vcf.gz 
# on both vcf to exclude all sites at which no alternative alleles are called for any of the samples
# checked this worked with: bcftools query F_MISSING_MAF_AC0_DP5_GQ20_gatk_filtered_miss40_mac_bi_snps_2019_merged_melas.vcf.gz -f'%AC\n' | sort -g | head
# used bcftools isec to check how many variants are in both populations of samples
# bcftools isec  -p cameroon_vs_gambia samples_filtered_cameroon.vcf.gz samples_filtered_bijagos.vcf.gz
# check number of snps in each vcf in the cameroon_vs_gambia directory, and the README.txt file tells us what each file means

# adding additional filter for reviewer of MAF 2% to remove singletons
# the remake the histogram to see if it has removed singletons
# then remake the PCAS and compare them
